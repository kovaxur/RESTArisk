# RESTArisk
Asterisk RealTime modular REST API

Why?
We would like to create a REST API for the Asterisk RealTime database. This should work with any database systems, and
also be modular to serve any requests. This should be used as backend for self-service administration systems.

The users should be able to create new SIP users, extensions, check their voicemail, and change their settings
without any contact to the support teams.
